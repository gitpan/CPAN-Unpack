NAME
    CPAN::Unpack - Unpack CPAN distributions

SYNOPSIS
      use CPAN::Unpack;
      my $u = CPAN::Unpack->new;
      $u->cpan("path/to/CPAN/");
      $u->destination("cpan_unpacked/");
      $u->quiet(1);
      $u->unpack;

DESCRIPTION
    The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) is a very useful
    collection of Perl code. It has a whole lot of module distributions.
    This module unpacks the latest version of each distribution. It places
    it in a directory of your choice with directories being the name of the
    distribution.

    It requires a local CPAN mirror to run. You can construct one using
    something similar to:

      /usr/bin/rsync -av --delete ftp.nic.funet.fi::CPAN /Users/acme/cpan/CPAN/

    Note that a CPAN mirror can take up about 1.5G of space (and will take a
    while to rsync initially). Additionally, unpacking will use up about
    another 1.6G.

    This can be handy for code metrics, searching CPAN, or just being very
    nosy indeed.

    This uses Parse::CPAN::Packages::Fast's latest_distributions method for
    finding the latest distribution.
