NAME
    CPAN::Unpack - Unpack CPAN distributions

SYNOPSIS
      use CPAN::Unpack;
      my $u = CPAN::Unpack->new;
      $u->cpan("t/cpan/");
      $u->destination("t/unpacked/");
      $u->unpack;

DESCRIPTION
    The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) is a very useful
    collection of Perl code. It has a whole lot of module distributions.
    This module unpacks the latest version of each distribution.

    This can be handy for code metrics, searching CPAN, or just being very
    nosy indeed.

    This uses Parse::CPAN::Packages' latest_distributions method for finding
    the latest distribution.
